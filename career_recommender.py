    - Are a strong fit for their background and goals
    - Suggest official job titles** that are commonly found on LinkedIn and job boards  (e.g., if the recommended role is "Technology Consultant - Healthcare", suggest normalized title like "Technology Consultant")
    - Are written to **maximize searchability and discoverability** when looking for people in those roles on LinkedIn

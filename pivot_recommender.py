Your mission: Recommend 2–3 **non-linear, high-potential career pivot opportunities** within the {sector} sector for this individual. These should not assume a direct step forward in their current career path, but instead reflect creative, adjacent, or cross-sector leaps that make use of their **transferable strengths**, **motivation for change**, and **passion indicators** ({input_data.hobbies_and_passions}).

Focus on:
- Roles they may not have considered but are an unexpected fit
- How their **soft skills, leadership traits, or cross-domain experience** could shine
- Opportunities for **identity-shifting roles** (e.g., teacher → UX researcher, ops lead → AI ethics consultant)
- Hybrid jobs and interdisciplinary roles gaining traction in {sector}
-Only recommend roles that are actively being hired for today. Validate each role title and at least one alternative title against real job listings in {preferred_location} using live job search.
Analyze this profile through multiple lenses:
